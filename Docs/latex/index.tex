This project is solution to the \char`\"{}\+Tower of Boxes\char`\"{} problem.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Task description}\label{index_autotoc_md1}
We have a set of {\itshape n} types boxes. All boxes are blocks with dimensions {\itshape h x w x l}. For the purpose of this task, it is not important which dimension is which.

Our goal is to build the highest tower possible but we have to follow these rules\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item We can build only upwards. One layer of the tower {\bfseries{must}} be made from one box only. That means we cannot place two boxes next to each other.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item We can rotate the box by 90Â° in all three axes.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item We can re-\/use the same box type, but all other rules must be followed.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item We can place on top only boxes, that have sides of base shorter than the current box on the top. That means, we cannot place two identical boxes on top of each other.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysubsection{Notes}\label{index_autotoc_md2}
The boxes are stored in {\itshape txt} file, on which the first line is the number of boxes we have. ~\newline
 Then we have the boxes, which are stored in following format\+: {\ttfamily h w l}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{Approach to the solution}\label{index_autotoc_md3}
The solution is derived from following source\+: \href{https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/box-stacking-problem-dp-22/}{\texttt{ https\+://www.\+geeksforgeeks.\+org/box-\/stacking-\/problem-\/dp-\/22/}}

First, we need to load the boxes from the file, which is handled by {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_file}{File}}} class. ~\newline
 We then pass all the loaded boxes into {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_tower}{Tower}}} class, using {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_tower_a2ca2a9b9f0e64c8d9413f8e81cd9de35}{Tower\+::\+Add\+Box()}}} method, which not only saved passed box, but all possible rotations.

When we added all the boxes, we wanted, we call {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_tower_aedcaef0da3aede9876406818e2e1a97b}{Tower\+::\+Create\+Tower()}}} method. First thing, we do, is sort all boxes by it\textquotesingle{}s area in ascending order. Then we call {\ttfamily Tower\+::\+Recursive\+Search()} method, which uses memoization to build the highest tower possible.

When the highest tower was created, we store it\textquotesingle{}s size into {\ttfamily Tower\+::max\+Height} variable and then we go though the {\ttfamily Tower\+::memoization} vector to search for the blocks we used to build the tower. We save these blocks into {\ttfamily Tower\+::tower} vector.

After we have built the tower, we can call {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_tower_ae42f1bbbf2ac2982a3f895360229a125}{Tower\+::\+Print\+Tower()}}} function which will print the result of our calculations in formated order. ~\newline
 Frist, we print the height of the tower, followed by all blocks we used in descending order (starting from base and going to the top).
